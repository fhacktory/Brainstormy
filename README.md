# Project origin
This project spawned at the occasion of Fhacktory (1st edition), a hackathon that took place in Lyon, France.
That saturday morning, we were trying hard to get a cool and innovative idea that would both impress the attendees and be useful. We got one: an app that helps you find cool and innovative ideas.
By letting you explore related concepts freely in the form of an infinite graph, Brainstormy is the perfect brainstorming assistant.
